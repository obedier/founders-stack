# Update — Upstream Sync

Pull the latest from Everything Claude Code and gstack into your founder-stack repo, then re-install to `~/.claude/`.

## Usage

`/update [options]`

## What It Does

1. Fetches latest commits from both upstream repos
2. Shows you what changed (commit log summary)
3. Asks for confirmation before applying
4. Copies updated files into founder-stack (preserving your custom orchestrate, sprint kit skills, and agent_docs)
5. Re-runs the installer to push changes to `~/.claude/`

## Execution

When the user runs `/update`:

### Step 1: Check for updates

```bash
bash ~/CodeProjects/founder-stack/scripts/update.sh --dry-run
```

Show the user the output — how many new commits from each upstream.

### Step 2: Apply (if user confirms)

```bash
bash ~/CodeProjects/founder-stack/scripts/update.sh
```

This will prompt for confirmation interactively.

### Step 3: Re-install

After updates are applied to the founder-stack repo:

```bash
bash ~/CodeProjects/founder-stack/install.sh --skip-gstack-build
```

Use `--skip-gstack-build` unless the gstack update includes browse binary changes.

### Step 4: Report

Show what was updated:
- Number of new commits applied (ECC + gstack)
- Any new agents, commands, or skills added
- Current upstream SHAs (from `.upstream` file)

## Protected Files

The update script **never overwrites**:
- `commands/orchestrate.md` — your unified workflow
- `commands/update.md` — this command
- `skills/kit-*` — sprint kit skills
- `skills/gstack/` — only updated from gstack upstream, not ECC
- `agent_docs/` — sprint kit coordination docs
- `templates/` — sprint kit templates
- `scripts/orchestrate-progress.js` — progress tracker

## Arguments

$ARGUMENTS:
- (none) — check both upstreams and apply
- `--ecc-only` — only check ECC
- `--gstack-only` — only check gstack
- `--dry-run` — show changes without applying
